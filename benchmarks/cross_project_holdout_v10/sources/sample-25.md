# UAQFact


## Overview

Data and code for datset UAQFact. The relevant paper is accepted by ACL 2025 Findings: [[ArXiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23461).


## Requirements

Ensure compatibility with `lm-evaluation-harness` v0.4.3. Our experiments are conducted in the following environment on Tesla V100-SXM2-32GB:
- lm-evaluation-harness 0.4.3
- PyTorch 2.3.1
- Transformers 4.46.3
- NumPy 2.1.3

Note: local environment differences (such as operating system version, GPU type) may lead to slight variations in evaluation results. Please refer to your local results for specifics.


## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/cytan17726/UAQ_Fact.git

cd lm-evaluation-harness
pip install -e .
```


## Evaluate Instructions

Please note that you can use any method you prefer for evaluation.

For our evaluation method, please refer to `eval_example_llama.sh` for an example evaluation of Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct. `NEC_refuse` represents the Refusal Rate, and `EM_hit` represents Accuracy.

You can calculate knowledge pass rate (KPR) using `parse_task2_res.py`.
