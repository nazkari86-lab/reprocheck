## Ensemble — conditional gain

On the 75 images where the ensemble beats the fast path, it
reduces CER from 0.849 to 0.245
(**71.2% relative reduction**). On easy/clean inputs the
selector routes to the fast path, so the ensemble cost is avoided.

## Confidence-weighted merge

Both merges run on identical engine outputs; the only difference is how
word-level disagreements are resolved (engine confidence vs text heuristic).

- Output changed on 134/296 images (where engines disagreed and both
  sides carried confidence).
- On those images: CER 0.560 → 0.329
  (**41.2% relative reduction**, +0.231 absolute).
- Corpus-wide: +0.104 absolute CER change.

| Source | changed | CER heuristic | CER conf | rel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| synthetic | 60 | 0.689 | 0.128 | +81.4% |
| sroie | 74 | 0.455 | 0.492 | -8.2% |

The aggregate is dominated by SROIE receipts, where engine confidence is poorly
calibrated and the merge is near-neutral. On domain-matched screen text the
confidence signal is reliable and the reduction is large, concentrated on
degraded inputs where the two engines genuinely disagree.

## Confidence calibration

Per-word reliability of raw engine confidence vs empirical word accuracy
(correctness from aligning recognized words to ground truth). ECE is the
population-weighted gap between confidence and accuracy across 10 bins; lower is
better. "ECE calibrated" refits a per-domain isotonic regression on a held-out
split, measured on the same held-out words.

| Domain | words | accuracy | mean conf | conf − acc | ECE raw | ECE calibrated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| synthetic | 4688 | 0.608 | 0.702 | +0.094 | 0.096 | 0.016 |
| sroie | 14316 | 0.441 | 0.760 | +0.320 | 0.325 | 0.028 |
| all | 19004 | 0.482 | 0.746 | +0.264 | 0.262 | 0.017 |

The "conf − acc" gap exposes the failure mode behind the merge result: on
out-of-domain receipts the engines are over-confident (positive gap, high raw
ECE), so confidence-weighted disagreement handling trusts the wrong side. A
per-domain isotonic refit collapses the ECE, which is the prerequisite for the
confidence merge to transfer beyond screen text.

### Calibrated merge (held-out images)

Replaying the confidence-weighted merge on a held-out image split with three
confidence sources — text heuristic, raw engine confidence, and a per-engine
isotonic calibration fit on the train split. The calibrator is wrapped around
the same word confidences the merge already consumes; no OCR is re-run. The
calibrator is fit per engine on purpose: the merge picks between engines by
comparing their confidences, so it is invariant to a shared monotone rescaling
and only an engine-specific map can re-rank one engine against the other.

| Domain | test img | CER heuristic | CER raw conf | CER calibrated | calib − raw |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| synthetic | 65 | 0.255 | 0.178 | 0.180 | +0.002 |
| sroie | 24 | 0.449 | 0.515 | 0.480 | -0.035 |
| all | 89 | 0.307 | 0.269 | 0.261 | -0.008 |

"calib − raw" is the CER change from feeding calibrated instead of raw
confidence into the merge. Raw confidence is a large win on domain-matched
screen text but a regression on out-of-domain receipts; calibration keeps the
screen-text win essentially intact while recovering about half of the receipt
regression, giving the best aggregate CER of the three sources. It does not by
itself beat the pure text heuristic on receipts — engine confidence there is too
degraded — but it removes most of the penalty for using one global merge policy.

## SymSpell correction

- On prose: +0.004 absolute CER change (negative = improvement).
- Overall: +0.000 absolute CER change.

## Strategy selector (GradientBoosting, trained on oracle labels)

- Samples: 216 (fast=147, ensemble=69)
- **Macro F1 (held-out 20%): 0.722**
- CV macro-F1: 0.709 ± 0.077
- Confusion matrix [rows=true fast/ensemble, cols=pred]: [[19, 11], [1, 13]]
- Top features: [('sharpness', 0.40710405628186813), ('brightness', 0.18827666818105018), ('text_density', 0.1732758860213452)]

### Vs label-only baselines (cross-validated, same folds)

| Policy | CV Macro F1 |
|---|---|
| always fast | 0.405 |
| always ensemble | 0.242 |
| majority | 0.405 |
| stratified random | 0.516 |
| **selector (GB)** | **0.709** |

The learned router beats the best static policy (stratified random,
CV macro F1 0.516) — routing on image features adds real signal over
always picking one mode or the class prior.

### Feature ablation (leave-one-out, same folds)

| Feature dropped | CV Macro F1 | Δ vs full |
|---|---|---|
| sharpness | 0.631 | +0.078 |
| noise_level | 0.641 | +0.068 |
| text_density | 0.695 | +0.014 |
| brightness | 0.707 | +0.002 |
| has_color | 0.709 | +0.000 |
| contrast | 0.738 | -0.029 |
| size_ratio | 0.742 | -0.033 |

Δ is the CV macro-F1 lost when the feature is removed. Positive = the feature
carries routing signal the rest can't recover; near-zero or negative = redundant
given the others. This is a stronger test than impurity importance, which can
rank a feature highly without it adding predictive value.
