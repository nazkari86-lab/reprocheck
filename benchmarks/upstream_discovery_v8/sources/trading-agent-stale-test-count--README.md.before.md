# trading-agent

A swing-trading agent that decides once per day on daily bars, writes down its
reasoning for every decision, and holds itself to pre-registered pass marks it
cannot move after seeing the data.

**It trades paper money only.** Going live needs two independent switches thrown
by hand — `mode: live` in `config.yaml` **and** `LIVE_TRADING_CONFIRMED=YES` in
`.env` (`src/broker.py:44`). Both ship off. No real money is managed, and there
is no product to buy.

## What makes this worth reading

Most trading-bot repos are a strategy. This one is mostly a **referee**, because
the strategies kept failing and the interesting problem turned out to be *how
you know*.

**Pre-registration, frozen by hash.** A claim is a YAML file — arms, clauses,
the pass mark, an honest prior, and the ways the result could fool you.
`scripts/register_gate.py` hashes the *parsed* spec (`src/gatespec.py`) and
records the digest **before** the run. `scripts/run_gate.py` then refuses to
score:

1. a spec that was never registered — no frozen pass mark means the result
   could not have been wrong;
2. a spec altered since registration — and the refusal **names the field that
   moved**, because `clauses.2.pp: 1.0 -> 3.0` is the finding while "the spec
   changed" only starts a search;
3. a snapshot whose sha256 is not the one the registration named.

Reformatting is deliberately *not* tampering: the hash tracks meaning, so a
freeze that cried wolf would be one people learned to bypass.

**A divergence register.** `docs/divergences.md` lists every place the simulator
and the live bot were found to differ — **17 as of 2026-08-05**, thirteen closed
by a **named test** and four open by construction, because "fixed in code" has been
wrong here before. Three of them were found within four days by reading code for
an adjacent task, which is the honest reason the file does not claim to be
complete.

**Negative controls on the guards.** Every guard in this repo has been mutated
to confirm the test protecting it goes red, then restored byte-exact. A guard
nothing can falsify is not a guard.

**1,729 tests as of 2026-08-05**, offline by design — no credentials, ever, in CI.

**The record is append-only.** `memory/ledger.jsonl` is the source of truth;
the dashboard, blog and journal are views rendered from it.

## What this has and has not shown

This is the section most repos leave out.

**One EDGE claim in fifteen has passed — and it does not mean what it looks
like.** As of 2026-08-04 the tally is **1 pass in 15**. The §51 pass ran on the
most survivor-selected universe in the project, carrying **+200.28pp** of
survivorship inflation — large enough to explain the result. Every spec froze the
asymmetry before the run — *a FAIL is decisive, a PASS is not* — so the caveat
was already in place when the pass arrived. §52 then found survivorship-free
replication **blocked** and **froze the EDGE budget**. None of it was quietly
dropped: every claim is written up in `knowledge/backtest_candidates.md` with the
verdict, the frozen prior, and what the result did and did not license. That file
carries the running count and is the only place it is kept.

**The shipped configuration fails its own gate.** §43 pointed
`backtest.enablement_gate` — the function that rejected every candidate — at the
strategies actually running, across four periods spanning 26 years, on the first
simulator that models what the live bot does. It failed **all four**:

| period | return | exposure-matched bar | margin |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2000–2006 | +9.45% | +29.02% | −19.57pp |
| 2007–2013 | +2.42% | +10.10% | −7.68pp |
| 2014–2019 | +56.71% | +62.61% | −5.90pp |
| 2022–2026 | −7.71% | +2.13% | −9.84pp |

The bar is buy-and-hold scaled to the exposure the bot actually carried — the
fair comparison for a bot that spends most of its time in cash.

Both columns come from the same survivor-selected universe, so the comparison is
fair on its own terms (§48) — but neither number is what a real account would
have seen. Over the identical 2000–2006 bars the snapshot's universe returned
+138.74% while SPY returned **+8.68%**. §51 sized the same effect at
**+200.28pp** on the 38-name universe.

**The one historical pass was an artifact.** 2014–2019 was the only period this
bot ever cleared its own gate. It cleared it on a simulator that did not model
the LLM judge, which downsizes 58% of live buys. With the judge modelled the
same period fails by 5.90pp. That is §42 and §43, and it took the count from
one-in-four to zero-in-four.

**There is no validated way to pick a winner here.** §34 tested the *selection
procedure itself*: single-split, fold-majority, and an oracle with the future in
hand all scored about the same as random. So a strategy that looks best on this
data cannot be trusted to be best, and the programme is allowed to reject but
not yet to accept.

**Live record: 8 closed round-trips as of 2026-08-04**, since 2026-07-14 —
+16.78%, +10.67%, +6.40%, −8.59%, −3.67%, −5.61%, +2.33%, +0.05%. **n=8 decides
nothing** in either direction, and no average of eight numbers belongs in a
README. Going live is gated behind **≥30 closed trades, ≥60 days, and attorney
review**, and at the current rate that is months away.

> **No performance number appears in this repo without its benchmark and its
> sample size.** That rule is why the table above has a bar column and why the
> live record has an `n`.

## Layout

| path | what it is |
|---|---|
| `GUIDE.md` | build-from-zero setup walkthrough |
| `knowledge/backtest_candidates.md` | the research record — every claim, prior, and verdict |
| `knowledge/principles.md` | the rules the project holds itself to |
| `research/specs/`, `registrations.jsonl`, `verdicts.jsonl` | frozen specs, their hashes, and what they returned |
| `docs/divergences.md` | simulator-vs-live differences and the test closing each |
| `docs/` | runbooks, SLOs, incident response, secret rotation, go-live checklist |
| `src/risk.py` | every rail; the live bot and the backtester call the same function |
| `src/backtest.py` | the simulator (`simulate_ensemble` is the one gates use) |
| `scripts/run_gate.py` | executes a frozen registration and records the verdict |

## Running it

Setup is in [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md). Briefly:

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.lock
cp .env.example .env                  # add your Alpaca PAPER keys
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q  # 1729, offline, no keys needed
.venv/bin/python -m src.deploycheck   # is the running code the reviewed code?
.venv/bin/python src/main.py          # one cycle
```

Preflight is not a separate command — `src/preflight.py` runs inside every
cycle (`src/main.py:576`) and **fails the cycle closed** if the config is
unsafe, which is the opposite polarity from `deploycheck` (fail-open, advisory).
A clean start prints nothing from it; a bad one prints `PREFLIGHT: <reason>` and
stops before any order.

`requirements.lock` pins all 58 packages including transitive ones. That matters
more than usual here: `numpy` and `pandas` arrive through the closure, nothing
names them, and a float changing in the last place is enough to move a profit
factor across an enablement threshold. **Bumping a pin is a change that must be
followed by re-running a frozen gate and confirming the recorded numbers still
reproduce.**
