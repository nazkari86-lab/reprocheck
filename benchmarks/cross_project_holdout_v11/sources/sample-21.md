## High-Performance Lock-Free Order Book Engine

A high-performance, thread-safe limit order book implementation written in Rust. This project provides a comprehensive order matching engine designed for low-latency trading systems, with a focus on concurrent access patterns and lock-free data structures.

### Key Features

- **Lock-Free Architecture**: Built using atomics and lock-free data structures to minimize contention and maximize throughput in high-frequency trading scenarios.

- **Multiple Order Types**: Support for various order types including standard limit orders, iceberg orders, post-only, fill-or-kill, immediate-or-cancel, good-till-date, trailing stop, pegged, market-to-limit, and reserve orders with custom replenishment logic.

- **Thread-Safe Price Levels**: Each price level can be independently and concurrently modified by multiple threads without blocking.

- **Advanced Order Matching**: Efficient matching algorithm for both market and limit orders, correctly handling complex order types and partial fills.

- **Performance Metrics**: Built-in statistics tracking for benchmarking and monitoring system performance.

- **Memory Efficient**: Designed to scale to millions of orders with minimal memory overhead.

### Design Goals

This order book engine is built with the following design principles:

1. **Correctness**: Ensure that all operations maintain the integrity of the order book, even under high concurrency.
2. **Performance**: Optimize for low latency and high throughput in both write-heavy and read-heavy workloads.
3. **Scalability**: Support for millions of orders and thousands of price levels without degradation.
4. **Flexibility**: Easily extendable to support additional order types and matching algorithms.

### Use Cases

- **Trading Systems**: Core component for building trading systems and exchanges
- **Market Simulation**: Tool for back-testing trading strategies with realistic market dynamics
- **Research**: Platform for studying market microstructure and order flow
- **Educational**: Reference implementation for understanding modern exchange architecture

### What's New in Version 0.12.0

#### v0.12.0 — pricelevel 0.9 hardening bump; upsize demotion survives snapshot restore (#205)

- **`pricelevel` 0.8.4 → 0.9.1.** Major upstream hardening release: level
  admission validates before mutating (duplicate id, counter capacity,
  price/side topology), PostOnly / fill-or-kill decisions are atomic with
  the sweep, execution statistics are torn-read-safe, and level snapshots
  materialize orders in queue-consumption order. 0.9.1 fixes the
  `MatchResult` bincode round-trip (PriceLevel#135), keeping the
  `bincode` feature's trade-event round-trip intact.
- **The upsize queue-priority demotion now survives a snapshot
  round-trip (#205).** Restoring a snapshot rebuilds each level's queue
  exactly as matching would consume it, so an order demoted by a quantity
  increase keeps its back-of-queue position after
  `restore_from_snapshot_package`. Locked in by a proptest regression
  (`tests/unit/props_quantity_update_priority.rs`). Snapshots captured
  with pricelevel < 0.9 restore demoted orders at their old
  `(timestamp, seq)` position — re-snapshot to pin the corrected order.
- **Breaking (semver-minor under 0.x):** `get_bt_bids` / `get_bt_asks`
  now return `Result<BTreeMap<u128, PriceLevel>, OrderBookError>`
  (snapshot-to-level conversion is validating and fallible upstream), and
  the re-exported pricelevel surface changed —
  `PriceLevel::add_order` returns `Result`, `matchable_quantity` takes
  the taker id, `PriceLevelError` gained `DuplicateOrderId`.
- **Atomic PostOnly / multi-level FOK (#209).** PostOnly submits thread
  `TakerKind::PostOnly` into every per-level match, making it
  structurally impossible for a post-only order to take liquidity under
  any interleaving; fill-or-kill submits hold a new book-level submit
  gate exclusively across feasibility + sweep, so multi-level
  all-or-nothing can no longer partially execute against concurrent
  cancels. Other mutating entry points take the gate's uncontended read
  side; the matching core stays lock-free. Full 0.11.0 → 0.12.0 HDR
  tail-latency comparison in `BENCH.md`: every scenario's median is
  unchanged by this release's book-level work; the one median shift
  (`stp_sweep`, from the pricelevel 0.9 hardening) is documented there
  with its bisection.
- **Atomic, observable mutation failures (#211).** `UpdateQuantity` is
  validate-first (projected tick / lot / min-max / representability /
  risk before touching the level), propagates upstream
  `PriceLevelError`s instead of returning `Ok(None)`, and updates risk
  counters on success; a taker whose residual cannot rest is rejected
  before the sweep trades; a failed racy admission cleans up any empty
  level it created.
- **Two-tranche quantity conservation (#210).** An aggressive iceberg's
  residual rests with exactly the unmatched total distributed across
  tranches (`visible = min(display, remainder)`, rest hidden) instead of
  inflating the book, and a `visible + hidden` overflow is rejected at
  admission with the new typed `OrderBookError::QuantityOverflow`
  before any trade or mutation. Conservation
  (`executed + resting == submitted`) is property-tested.
- **`snapshots_match` compares full maker state and FIFO (#208).** The
  replay oracle now checks every level's order vector in
  queue-consumption order (ids, variants, users, quantities,
  timestamps, TIF, type-specific fields) and the deterministic
  statistics counters including `stats_degraded`; only the wall-time
  statistics aggregates (`first_arrival_time`, `last_execution_time`,
  `sum_waiting_time` — see the `snapshots_match` docs for why each is
  inherently divergent) and the capture timestamp stay excluded.
  Contract tightening: aggregate-equal books with reversed FIFO or
  different maker identity no longer certify as replay-equal.
- **Failure-atomic snapshot restore (#207).** `restore_from_snapshot` and
  `restore_from_snapshot_package` validate every level (and reject
  cross-level duplicate order ids with `DuplicateOrderId`) against
  off-book structures before clearing the live book, so a failed restore
  leaves the pre-restore state — orders, indices, config, risk,
  kill-switch, engine sequence — completely untouched.
- **Snapshot package format v3 (#206).** Pricelevel 0.9 statistics can
  serialize a `stats_degraded` field that 0.8 readers reject, so newly
  written packages are stamped `ORDERBOOK_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT_VERSION = 3`.
  Reads accept `ORDERBOOK_SNAPSHOT_MIN_READ_VERSION (2)..=3` — legacy v2
  packages still restore — while `1` and future versions stay rejected
  with the existing typed error.

### What's New in Version 0.11.0

#### v0.11.0 — replay reproduces the trade-ID stream: namespace in `ReplayBookConfig` (#200)

- **`ReplayBookConfig.trade_id_namespace: Option<Uuid>`.** v0.10.5 (#199)
  made the trade-ID namespace injectable on `OrderBook`, but every
  `ReplayEngine::replay_from*` entry point still built its book with a
  random namespace, so trade IDs produced through the shipped replay API
  were not reproducible. The config now carries the live book's
  namespace and applies it via `OrderBook::set_trade_id_namespace`
  before any journal events are replayed; a `*_with_config` replay under
  an injected `Clock` then reproduces the live trade-ID stream
  byte-identically. `ReplayBookConfig::new` keeps its six structural
  parameters (namespace defaults to `None`) — chain the new
  `with_trade_id_namespace(namespace)` builder to set it. Without a
  namespace the fresh book keeps a random one, as before.
- **Suffix replays with a namespace are rejected.** Applying a
  namespace restarts the trade-ID counter at 0, so a namespace-carrying
  config with `from_sequence != 0` would mint wrong or duplicate IDs;
  the `*_with_config` entry points return the new typed
  `ReplayError::NamespaceRequiresFullReplay` instead. Namespace-free
  suffix replay keeps working.
- **Breaking (semver-minor under 0.x):** `ReplayBookConfig` gained a
  public field, so exhaustive struct literals no longer compile — add
  `trade_id_namespace: None` or use `..Default::default()`; and
  `ReplayError` gained the `NamespaceRequiresFullReplay` variant, so
  exhaustive matches need a new arm.
  `ReplayBookConfig::new(...)` callers are unaffected. No journal or
  snapshot format change, no `ORDERBOOK_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT_VERSION` bump.

### What's New in Version 0.10.5

#### v0.10.5 — injectable trade-ID namespace (#199)

- **`OrderBook::set_trade_id_namespace(&mut self, namespace: Uuid)`.**
  Every constructor used to mint the trade-ID namespace internally with
  `Uuid::new_v4()`, so trade IDs differed between a live run and its
  replay even with an injected `Clock` and an identical command stream —
  the namespace was the only entropy left in the trade-ID stream
  (`pricelevel::UuidGenerator` is UUID v5 over namespace + counter).
  The new setter, symmetric with `set_clock`, replaces the generator
  (counter restarts at 0) and composes with every existing constructor.
  Call it before any orders are submitted.
- **`OrderBook::with_clock_and_namespace(symbol, clock, namespace)`.**
  Convenience constructor for the fully deterministic setup (injected
  clock + injected namespace): the same command stream then produces
  byte-identical trade IDs across live/replay. A deterministic
  namespace choice such as UUID v5 of the symbol under a venue root
  gives every book a stable, distinct stream.
- Default constructors are unchanged: without injection each book still
  gets a fresh random namespace. No wire-format or snapshot change, no
  `ORDERBOOK_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT_VERSION` bump. Note the guarantee currently
  applies to books you construct yourself; the sequencer's
  `ReplayEngine` entry points still build their books with a random
  namespace — wiring the seam into `ReplayBookConfig` is tracked in
  issue #200.

### What's New in Version 0.10.4

#### v0.10.4 — exact-fee API: `try_calculate_fee` + published guaranteed-exact bound (#197)

- **`FeeSchedule::try_calculate_fee(notional, is_maker) -> Result<i128, FeeOverflow>`.**
  Fallible variant of `calculate_fee` with identical rounding
  (truncation toward zero, sign applied after the unsigned-domain
  magnitude) that returns the new `FeeOverflow` error instead of
  clamping when `notional × |bps|` overflows `u128`. An `Ok` value is
  always the mathematically exact fee and equals `calculate_fee`'s
  output, so journaled / replayable venues can reject an order rather
  than record a clamped fee.
- **Published guaranteed-exact input bound.**
  `FeeSchedule::max_guaranteed_exact_notional_for_bps(bps)` (`const fn`)
  returns the multiplication-safety bound `u128::MAX / |bps|`
  (`u128::MAX` for a zero rate) at or below which the fee is guaranteed
  exact, and `FeeSchedule::max_guaranteed_exact_notional()` takes the
  minimum over the maker and taker legs — a single venue-level admission
  bound that makes the saturating branch of `calculate_fee` provably
  unreachable. The guarantee is sufficient, not tight: above the bound
  `try_calculate_fee` rejects conservatively even though the clamped
  `calculate_fee` value can coincide with the exact fee at isolated
  notionals.
- `calculate_fee` behavior is unchanged (bit-identical, including the
  saturated clamp of magnitude `u128::MAX / 10_000`); its docs now state
  the exactness guarantee. `FeeOverflow` is re-exported at the crate
  root. No wire-format change, no
  `ORDERBOOK_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT_VERSION` bump.

### What's New in Version 0.10.3

#### v0.10.3 — special-order tracker survives snapshot restore (#194)

- **Restored pegged / trailing-stop orders re-price again.**
  `restore_from_snapshot` rebuilt the resting book but left the
  `special_order_tracker` (the `special_orders` feature) freshly-initialized,
  so a restored pegged or trailing-stop order was never re-registered and
  never re-priced after a snapshot restore. The shared rebuild pass now
  re-registers every restored resting special order in the same deterministic
  price-then-insertion-sequence walk that repopulates `order_locations` /
  `user_orders`. The tracker holds only order ids — the trailing-stop
  watermark (`last_reference_price`) and the pegged / stop price live in the
  order data and survive the round-trip, so no re-pricing state is lost.
- No wire-format or public-API change: no new fields, no event-shape change,
  and no `ORDERBOOK_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT_VERSION` bump.

### What's New in Version 0.10.2

#### v0.10.2 — deterministic `user_orders` rebuild on snapshot restore (#192)

- **`cancel_orders_by_user` is now byte-identical across restores.**
  `restore_from_snapshot_package` rebuilt the `user_orders` index from each
  level's order-unstable `iter_orders()` view, so the per-user `Vec<Id>` came
  back in a different order on every fresh book (the `DashMap` hasher is seeded
  per instance) and a post-restore `cancel_orders_by_user` diverged across
  restores of the same package. The rebuild now walks price levels in the same
  fixed price-then-insertion-sequence order the mass-cancel sweeps use
  (`PriceLevel::snapshot_by_seq_into`), so the restored index — and any
  subsequent by-user cancel — is deterministic across every restore. The order
  reflects the resting book at snapshot time, not the original admission
  history (a snapshot cannot recover that). Pure journal replay was unaffected.
- No wire-format or public-API change: no new fields, no event-shape change,
  and no `ORDERBOOK_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT_VERSION` bump.

### What's New in Version 0.10.1

#### v0.10.1 — replay-stable mass-cancel result ordering (#190)

- **Deterministic `cancelled_order_ids` ordering.** `cancel_all_orders`,
  `cancel_orders_by_side`, and `cancel_orders_by_price_range` now enumerate
  cancelled orders through the same fixed traversal the eviction sweep uses:
  bids first then asks; within a side, price levels in ascending price (the
  `SkipMap`'s natural key order, no sort); within a level, ascending insertion
  sequence (`PriceLevel::snapshot_by_seq_into`, the exact order the matching
  engine consumes resting orders). Previously the ids were read from
  order-unstable structures (`order_locations` / per-level `iter_orders`) whose
  `DashMap` hasher is seeded per instance, so two processes replaying the same
  command stream could journal divergent `SequencerResult::MassCancelled`
  payloads. The cancelled **set** and **count** are unchanged — only the order
  of `cancelled_order_ids` is now byte-identical across processes and replay.
- **`cancel_orders_by_user` is unchanged** and was already replay-stable: it
  drains the `user_orders` index in admission-history order. That determinism
  contract is now documented alongside the others.
- No wire-format or public-API change: no new fields, no event-shape change,
  and no `ORDERBOOK_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT_VERSION` bump.

### What's New in Version 0.10.0

#### v0.10.0 — host-driven GTD / DAY expiry sweep (#189)

- **New `OrderBook::evict_expired_orders(now_ms)`** — a host-driven sweep
  that removes every resting order whose time-in-force has expired as of the
  caller-supplied timestamp. `now_ms` is [`TimestampMs`] (Unix milliseconds,
  the same unit `clock().now_millis()` compares against) and is passed in by
  the caller — the sweep never reads the book's own clock — so a scheduler
  drives cadence and the sequencer can journal the exact cutoff. The matching
  hot path is untouched: there is no lazy per-match expiry check, so expiry is
  an explicit maintenance pass, not an implicit cost on every submit. The
  honest consequence: an expired-but-unswept `Gtd` / `Day` order remains
  resting and matchable — it can still trade until the host calls the sweep;
  the no-post-expiry-trade guarantee holds only after the sweep runs. Expiry
  uses the single boundary predicate that admission uses (`now >= deadline`
  for `Gtd`, `now >= market_close` for `Day`), so an order admitted at a given
  instant is never simultaneously evictable at that instant. Returns the
  evicted orders as `Vec<Arc<OrderType<T>>>`; a second sweep at the same
  `now_ms` is idempotent and returns empty.
- **Deterministic eviction order.** Evicted orders — and the
  `Cancelled { reason: TimeInForceExpired }` state transitions and
  `PriceLevelChangedEvent`s emitted as a side effect — follow one fixed,
  replay-stable order: bids first then asks; within a side, price levels in
  ascending price (the `SkipMap`'s natural key order, no sort); within a
  level, ascending insertion sequence (the exact order the matching engine
  consumes resting orders — not the non-deterministic `iter_orders` view).
  Each order is removed through the same single-order cancel path as
  `cancel_order`, so the price-level cache, depth statistics,
  `order_locations` / `user_orders` indices, risk state, special-order
  tracker, and order-state tracker all stay consistent.
- **Manager parity.** `BookManagerStd` and `BookManagerTokio` gain
  `evict_expired_orders(symbol, now_ms)` (per-symbol pass-through, `None` for
  an unknown symbol) and `evict_expired_across_books(now_ms)` (all books,
  mirroring the `cancel_*_across_books` idiom).
- **Journaled as a sequencer command.** New
  `SequencerCommand::EvictExpiredOrders { now_ms }` variant (appended, so
  existing journals' bincode variant indices are unchanged). Replay applies
  the journaled cutoff — never the replay clock — so the sweep reproduces
  byte-identically; `snapshots_match` holds between a live book and its
  replay. Old journals replay unchanged; new journals carrying the variant
  fail on older binaries, consistent with the `MarketOrderByAmount`
  precedent. No `ORDERBOOK_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT_VERSION` bump required (the version
  gates the snapshot package, not the journal command enum).
- **Breaking (the reason this is 0.10.0):** `SequencerCommand` and
  `SequencerResult` are now `#[non_exhaustive]`. Downstream code that
  matches them exhaustively must add a wildcard arm (`_ => …`) once and
  recompile; in exchange, future command/result additions are
  source-compatible instead of repeating this break. Adding the
  `EvictExpiredOrders` variant itself is what surfaced the hazard: on the
  previously-exhaustive enum it would have silently broken downstream
  matches inside the 0.9.x range.
- **`TimestampMs` re-exported** at the crate root and via [`prelude`], so the
  new `now_ms` parameter can be constructed without reaching into
  `pricelevel` directly.
- Runnable example: `cargo run -p examples --bin gtd_expiry_sweep`.

### What's New in Version 0.9.2

#### v0.9.2 — constant-work per-price aggregates + attribution & unit docs (#185, #186, #187)

- **Constant-work per-price aggregate accessors (#186)** — an O(log N)
  point lookup + O(1) counter read, with no per-order materialization. New
  read-only methods on [`OrderBook<T>`]: `visible_quantity_at_price`,
  `hidden_quantity_at_price`, `total_quantity_at_price`, and
  `order_count_at_price`. Each does an O(log N) `SkipMap` point lookup then
  reads the level's maintained atomic counter (one relaxed load; two for
  `total_quantity_at_price`, which sums visible + hidden) — no per-order
  `Arc` is materialized and no `T: Default` conversion runs, so they are the
  cheap way to poll one level's depth or count. `order_count_at_price` is
  the counterpart to `queue_ahead_at_price` that drops the per-order term:
  O(log N) here vs O(log N + K) for the queue-walking version. All four
  return `None` for an absent level and read advisory, eventually-consistent
  counters — take `create_snapshot` for a mutually-consistent view.
- **Per-call fill attribution, documented and proven (#185).** The
  `add_order_with_result` guarantee is now explicit: concurrent submits on
  the same book each receive exactly their own fills, because the
  `TradeResult` is built from that call's private `MatchResult` and the
  engine holds no shared trade accumulator. On the error-after-fills paths
  (an unfillable IOC remainder, or a self-trade-prevention cancellation
  after earlier non-self fills) the caller instead gets the typed `Err` and
  the executed fills reach only the trade listener. A multi-thread
  concurrency test pins it. New convenience wrappers
  `add_limit_order_with_result` and `add_limit_order_with_user_and_result`
  mirror the plain `add_limit_order*` builders while returning the
  `TradeResult` directly.
- **GTD / market-close millisecond unit documented (#187).** `has_expired`,
  `set_market_close_timestamp`, and the `time_in_force` parameter docs now
  state that GTD deadlines and the market-close timestamp are milliseconds
  since the Unix epoch (the same unit `clock().now_millis()` compares
  against). A pinning test proves a seconds-form deadline reads as instantly
  expired.

### What's New in Version 0.9.1

#### v0.9.1 — `add_order_with_result` (#184)

- **New public API** on [`OrderBook<T>`]: `add_order_with_result` submits an
  order and returns the `TradeResult` produced by the match directly —
  `Ok((Arc<OrderType<T>>, Option<TradeResult>))` — instead of relying on the
  `TradeListener` callback. `None` when the order produced no fills; an
  installed listener still fires with the exact same `TradeResult`.
  `add_order` is unchanged in behavior and stays free of the extra
  `MatchResult` clone when no listener is installed.

### What's New in Version 0.9.0

#### v0.9.0 — Upgrade to `pricelevel` 0.8.0 (#130)

- **Price-time priority preserved across partial fills.** Picks up the
  upstream `pricelevel` fix (PriceLevel#39) where a partially-filled resting
  maker keeps its place at the front of the level queue, resolving #88: a
  partial fill no longer demotes the maker behind later same-price arrivals.
  Locked in by `test_partial_fill_preserves_price_time_priority_issue_88`.
- **Deterministic match timestamps.** `PriceLevel::match_order` no longer
  reads the wall clock; the engine passes the book's [`Clock`]
  time as the taker timestamp, so trade timestamps follow the installed clock
  and replay stays deterministic.
- **Domain newtypes on the public surface (breaking).** Through the
  `pricelevel` re-exports and `MatchResult` / `OrderType` accessors, several
  values now carry `Quantity` / `Price` / `TimestampMs` instead of raw
  `u64` / `u128` (e.g. `MatchResult::remaining_quantity()` now returns
  `Quantity`). OrderBook-rs's own snapshot / statistics queries are unchanged
  and still return raw integers; downstream code reading `pricelevel` types
  through the re-exports may need `.as_u64()` / `.as_u128()`. Minor bump under
  `0.x` semver.
- **Dependency refresh:** `pricelevel` 0.7→0.8, `async-nats` 0.47→0.49,
  `dashmap` 6.1→6.2, `bitflags` 2.11→2.13, `either` 1.15→1.16,
  `crc32fast` 1→1.5, `proptest` 1.7→1.11.

### What's New in Version 0.8.0

#### v0.8.0 — Quote-notional market orders (#85)

- **New public API** on [`OrderBook<T>`]:
  [`match_market_order_by_amount`](OrderBook::match_market_order_by_amount)
  and the STP-aware
  [`match_market_order_by_amount_with_user`](OrderBook::match_market_order_by_amount_with_user),
  plus the convenience
  [`submit_market_order_by_amount`](OrderBook::submit_market_order_by_amount)
  and
  [`submit_market_order_by_amount_with_user`](OrderBook::submit_market_order_by_amount_with_user)
  wrappers that run the kill-switch and pre-trade risk gates.
- **Binance `quoteOrderQty` semantics.** Callers say "buy ~$1,000 of BTC"
  without converting to base quantity. The matching loop walks the
  opposite side until the requested quote-notional `amount` is
  consumed, the book is exhausted, or — when `lot_size` is configured
  on the book — the residual notional cannot fund another whole lot.
  Fees are **exclusive**: caller pays `amount + taker_fee`.
- **Lot enforcement preserved.** Per-level base quantity is rounded
  down to a multiple of `lot_size`, so notional walks never emit
  `qty=0` trades when the budget falls below one full lot at the
  current level price. `lot_size = None` is equivalent to `lot = 1`.
- **New error variant
  [`OrderBookError::InsufficientLiquidityNotional`]** — distinct from
  `InsufficientLiquidity` so callers can pattern-match on
  quote-vs-base semantics.
- **`TradeResult.quote_notional: u128`** — populated for *both* the
  base-quantity and quote-notional market-order paths so consumers
  read `Σ price × quantity` directly without recomputing per-trade.
  `#[serde(default)]` keeps existing JSON / Bincode payloads
  parseable.
- **Additive `SequencerCommand::MarketOrderByAmount { id, amount, side }`**
  variant. Old journals replay byte-identical; new journals carrying
  this variant fail on older binaries — consistent with the precedent
  for prior `SequencerCommand` rollouts. No
  `ORDERBOOK_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT_VERSION` bump required.
- **`StopCondition` refactor of the matching loop** — single inner
  implementation drives both base-qty and notional walks. Base-qty
  path stays allocation- and branch-light: the new helpers fold to
  the same arithmetic the previous loop emitted when `lot <= 1`.
- Runnable example: `cargo run -p examples --bin market_order_by_amount`.
- HDR bench: `notional_walk_hdr` mirrors `aggressive_walk_hdr` with
  the notional path so p50/p99/p99.9/p99.99 can be compared.

### What's New in Version 0.7.0

#### v0.7.0 — Feature-gated allocation counter

- **New feature `alloc-counters`** (default off). Exposes
  \[`CountingAllocator`\] and \[`AllocSnapshot`\] at the crate root.
  Wraps any inner [`GlobalAlloc`](std::alloc::GlobalAlloc) and
  tracks four `AtomicU64` counters: `allocs`, `deallocs`,
  `bytes_allocated`, `bytes_deallocated`.
- Bench / test binaries opt in via
  `#[global_allocator] static A: CountingAllocator<System> = ...`.
  The library `rlib` does **not** install a global allocator.
- **`bench_count`** bench + **`alloc_budget_tests`** integration
  test run the mixed 70/20/10 workload; the bench reports
  `allocs_per_op`, the test asserts a conservative ceiling for
  regression detection.
- **`BENCH.md`** gains an "Allocation profile" section.

#### v0.7.0 — Metrics and Observability (#60)

- **New optional `metrics` feature** wires Prometheus-style
  counters and gauges into the matching engine. Default `off`;
  when enabled, every increment goes through the global
  [`metrics`](https://docs.rs/metrics) facade so any compatible
  recorder (Prometheus exporter, OpenTelemetry bridge, etc.)
  can collect them.
- **Surface (stable across `0.7.x`):**
  - `orderbook_rejects_total{reason="..."}` — counter, one
    increment per rejected order. Label value is the
    [`RejectReason`] [`Display`](std::fmt::Display) string.
  - `orderbook_depth_levels_bid` /
    `orderbook_depth_levels_ask` — gauges, current count of
    distinct price levels on each side. Updated on every
    structural mutation (add, cancel, modify, fill).
  - `orderbook_trades_total` — counter, monotonic count of
    every emitted trade transaction (one increment per
    `MatchResult` transaction).
- **Determinism preserved.** Metrics emission is out-of-band:
  no allocation on the happy path, no influence on matching
  outcomes, and `restore_from_snapshot_package` deliberately
  does **not** rehydrate counters — they are operational only
  and live for the process lifetime. The integration test
  `tests/metrics/` proves byte-identical snapshots between two
  books with metrics enabled.
- **Compile-time no-op.** When the feature is off every helper
  in [`orderbook::metrics`] compiles to an empty function so
  call-sites in the matching hot path stay unconditional.
- Example: `examples/src/bin/prometheus_export.rs` (run with
  `cargo run --features metrics --bin prometheus_export`)
  demonstrates installing the `metrics-exporter-prometheus`
  recorder and dumping the exposition payload.

#### v0.7.0 — Feature-gated binary wire protocol

- **New `wire` feature flag** behind which a small,
  length-prefixed binary protocol lives — every frame is
  `[len:u32 LE | kind:u8 | payload]`, `len` covers
  `kind + payload`, and all multi-byte integers are
  little-endian. Disabled by default; the existing JSON and
  bincode paths are unchanged. The protocol is additive.
- **`MessageKind`** — `#[repr(u8)]` enum with stable explicit
  discriminants. Inbound: `NewOrder = 0x01`,
  `CancelOrder = 0x02`, `CancelReplace = 0x03`,
  `MassCancel = 0x04`. Outbound: `ExecReport = 0x81`,
  `TradePrint = 0x82`, `BookUpdate = 0x83`.
- **Zero-copy inbound** — `NewOrderWire`, `CancelOrderWire`,
  `CancelReplaceWire`, `MassCancelWire` are
  `#[repr(C, packed)]` with `zerocopy::{FromBytes, IntoBytes,
  Unaligned, Immutable, KnownLayout}` derives. Each ships a
  `const _: () = assert!(size_of::<…>() == N)` guard. Decoding
  is safe — `zerocopy` performs the layout validation, no
  `unsafe` is required at any wire call site.
- **Byte-cursor outbound** — `ExecReport`, `TradePrintWire`,
  `BookUpdateWire` are encoded via explicit
  `extend_from_slice` calls. Outbound is I/O-dominated; this
  keeps the layout free to evolve.
- **`TryFrom<&NewOrderWire> for OrderType<()>`** — boundary
  mapping that copies each packed field into a stack local
  first (taking a reference to a packed field is UB), validates
  the side / TIF / order_type discriminants, and rejects
  negative prices via `WireError::InvalidPayload`.
- **`doc/wire-protocol.md`** with per-message layout tables,
  discriminant table, framing rule, and endianness statement.
- **Round-trip `proptest` coverage** in every
  `src/wire/{inbound,outbound}/*.rs` module.
- Example: `examples/src/bin/wire_roundtrip.rs`
  (`required-features = ["wire"]`).

#### v0.7.0 — HDR-histogram tail-latency bench suite

- **Six new `*_hdr` bench binaries** under
  `benches/order_book/`: `add_only`, `cancel_only`,
  `aggressive_walk`, `mixed_70_20_10`, `thin_book_sweep`,
  `mass_cancel_burst`. Each records per-sample nanosecond
  latencies into an `hdrhistogram::Histogram` and emits
  `p50` / `p99` / `p99.9` / `p99.99` + `min` / `max`. Coexists
  with the existing Criterion benches.
- **`make bench-hdr`** convenience target.
- **Headline numbers + methodology** in `BENCH.md` at the repo
  root, with a closed-loop disclosure block (the suite measures
  service time, not load-induced tail).

#### v0.7.0 — Closed `RejectReason` enum

- **New [`RejectReason`]** — closed
  `#[non_exhaustive] #[repr(u16)]` enum with stable explicit
  discriminants (1..13 + `Other(u16)`). The canonical wire-side
  reject taxonomy; consumers can route on the numeric code without
  parsing strings.
- **`OrderStatus::Rejected.reason: String`** is now
  `RejectReason` — typed, machine-routable, and stable across
  `0.7.x`. Breaking change on a public variant shape; allowed under
  the `0.6.x → 0.7.x` minor delta in `0.x` semver.
- **`impl From<&OrderBookError> for RejectReason`** — operational
  ergonomics. Exhaustive match — a future `OrderBookError` variant
  addition is caught at compile time.
- **Tracker emission on every reject path that already transitioned
  the tracker.** Kill switch, risk gates, and the three internal
  sites in `modifications.rs` (validation / post-only / missing
  user id) now record typed reasons. STP cancel-taker and IOC/FOK
  `InsufficientLiquidity` paths still return typed errors without
  transitioning the tracker — deferred to a follow-up.

#### v0.7.0 — Pre-trade risk layer

- **New [`RiskConfig`]** with three opt-in guard-rails:
  `max_open_orders_per_account`, `max_notional_per_account`, and
  `price_band_bps` against a configurable
  [`ReferencePriceSource`] (`LastTrade` / `Mid` / `FixedPrice`).
  Builder pattern — `RiskConfig::new().with_*(...)` chained.
- **Three new typed reject variants** on the existing
  `#[non_exhaustive]` `OrderBookError`:
  `RiskMaxOpenOrders`, `RiskMaxNotional`, `RiskPriceBand`. Each
  carries enough context (account, current, limit, deviation) for
  downstream consumers to act without parsing a string.
- **`OrderBook::set_risk_config(...)` / `risk_config()` /
  `disable_risk()`** — operator-driven gating. Check ordering on
  submit/add: `kill_switch → risk → STP → fees → match`. Market
  orders bypass the risk layer (no submitted price, no rest);
  kill switch still gates them.
- **Allocation-free** on the happy path. Per-account counters are
  `(AtomicU64, AtomicCell<u128>)` pairs; per-order risk state is a
  `DashMap<Id, RiskEntry>`.
- **`OrderBookSnapshotPackage.risk_config: Option<RiskConfig>`** —
  config persists across snapshot/restore. On restore, per-account
  counters and the per-order map are rebuilt by walking the
  snapshot's resting orders. Snapshot format version stays at `2`;
  the field is additive via `#[serde(default)]`.
- Example: `examples/src/bin/risk_limits.rs`.

#### v0.7.0 — Operational kill switch

- **New `OrderBook::engage_kill_switch()`,
  `OrderBook::release_kill_switch()`, and
  `OrderBook::is_kill_switch_engaged()`** — atomic operational halt
  for new flow. While engaged, every `submit_market_order*`,
  `add_order`, and non-`Cancel` `update_order` call returns the new
  [`OrderBookError::KillSwitchActive`] variant before any matching,
  fee, or STP work happens. Cancel and mass-cancel paths are
  explicitly **not** gated so operators can drain the resting book.
  The flag persists across snapshot/restore.
- **`OrderBookError::KillSwitchActive`** — new typed reject variant
  on the existing `#[non_exhaustive]` enum.
- **`OrderBookSnapshotPackage.kill_switch_engaged: bool`** —
  operational state persists across snapshot/restore. Snapshot
  format version stays at `2`; the field is additive via
  `#[serde(default)]`.
- When an `OrderStateTracker` is configured, kill-switched
  rejections are recorded as
  `OrderStatus::Rejected { reason: RejectReason::KillSwitchActive }`.
- Example: `examples/src/bin/kill_switch_drain.rs`.

#### v0.7.0 — Global `engine_seq` across outbound streams

- **New `OrderBook::next_engine_seq()` and `OrderBook::engine_seq()`**
  accessors backed by an `AtomicU64` counter. Every outbound emission
  (trade event, price-level change event) mints exactly one seq, in
  emission order, so external consumers can perform cross-stream gap
  detection and merge events from `TradeListener` and
  `PriceLevelChangedListener` into a single ordered view.
- **`engine_seq: u64` field** added to every outbound event type:
  `TradeResult`, `TradeEvent`, `PriceLevelChangedEvent`, and the NATS
  `BookChangeEntry`. JSON payloads are forward-compatible
  (`#[serde(default)]` falls back to `0` for v0.6.x payloads).
- **Snapshot format version bumped to `2`**.
  `OrderBookSnapshotPackage` carries `engine_seq` so that
  `restore_from_snapshot_package` resumes monotonicity exactly from the
  snapshotted point. `version: 1` packages are rejected by `validate()`.
- **`BookChangeBatch.sequence`** retains its existing per-batch
  publisher-counter semantics; cross-stream gap detection moves to the
  per-event `BookChangeEntry.engine_seq`. Both fields ship in the same
  payload for incremental adoption.

#### v0.7.0 — `Clock` trait for deterministic replay

- **New [`Clock`] trait** with two implementations, [`MonotonicClock`]
  (production, wraps `SystemTime::now`) and [`StubClock`] (replay /
  tests, monotonic `AtomicU64` counter with configurable start and
  step). Re-exported at the crate root and via [`prelude`].
- **[`OrderBook::with_clock`]** constructor plus `set_clock` and
  `clock()` accessors. The default [`OrderBook::new`] keeps wrapping
  [`MonotonicClock`] internally — existing callers observe no
  behavioural change.
- **`ReplayEngine::replay_from_with_clock`** for byte-identical
  replay tests and disaster-recovery pipelines that must reproduce
  engine timestamps deterministically.
- Wall-clock reads are no longer present inside the matching core —
  every stamp flows through `self.clock().now_millis()`.
- **Behavioural change (same type signature)**:
  `OrderStateTracker::get_history` and `OrderBook::get_order_history`
  now return `Vec<(u64 /* milliseconds */, OrderStatus)>` instead of
  nanoseconds; the `Clock::now_millis` unit is the only one the trait
  exposes.

#### v0.6.2 — Dependency Bumps & Bincode 2.x Migration

- **Dependency refresh**: `uuid` 1.23, `tokio` 1.52, `sha2` 0.11,
  `async-nats` 0.47, `bincode` 2.0 (crates.io `bincode 3.0.0` is a
  `compile_error!` stub, so `2.0` is the current usable major).
- **Bincode API migration** (feature `bincode`): the
  `BincodeEventSerializer` now uses `bincode::serde::encode_to_vec`
  / `decode_from_slice` with `bincode::config::standard()`. The
  public trait and type surface are unchanged.
- **Wire-format note**: bincode 1.x and 2.x produce different byte
  layouts on the NATS transport path. The on-disk journal uses
  `serde_json` and is unaffected (`ORDERBOOK_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT_VERSION`
  stays at `1`).

#### v0.6.1 — NATS Integration, Sequencer & Order State

- **NATS JetStream Publishers**: Trade event and book change publishers with retry, batching, and throttling (`nats` feature)
- **Zero-Copy Serialization**: Pluggable `EventSerializer` trait with JSON and Bincode implementations (`bincode` feature)
- **Sequencer Subsystem**: `SequencerCommand`, `SequencerEvent`, `SequencerResult` types for LMAX Disruptor-style total ordering
- **Append-Only Journal**: `FileJournal` with memory-mapped segments, CRC32 checksums, and segment rotation (`journal` feature)
- **In-Memory Journal**: `InMemoryJournal` for testing and benchmarking
- **Deterministic Replay**: `ReplayEngine` for disaster recovery and state verification from journal
- **Order State Machine**: `OrderStatus`, `CancelReason`, `OrderStateTracker` for explicit lifecycle tracking (Open → PartiallyFilled → Filled / Cancelled / Rejected)
- **Order Lifecycle Query API**: `get_order_history()`, `active_order_count()`, `terminal_order_count()`, `purge_terminal_states()`
- **Upgrade to pricelevel v0.7**: `Id`, `Price`, `Quantity`, `TimestampMs` newtypes for stronger type safety

#### v0.5.x — Validation, STP, Fees & Mass Cancel

- **Order Validation**: Tick size, lot size, and min/max order size validation with configurable limits
- **Self-Trade Prevention (STP)**: `CancelTaker`, `CancelMaker`, `CancelBoth` modes with per-order `user_id` enforcement
- **Fee Model**: Configurable `FeeSchedule` with maker/taker fees, fee fields in `TradeResult`
- **Mass Cancel Operations**: Cancel all, by side, by user, by price range — with `MassCancelResult` tracking
- **Cross-Book Mass Cancel**: `cancel_all_across_books()`, `cancel_by_user_across_books()`, `cancel_by_side_across_books()` on `BookManager`
- **Snapshot Config Preservation**: `restore_from_snapshot_package()` preserves fee schedule, STP mode, tick/lot size, and order size limits

#### v0.4.8 — Performance & Architecture

- **Performance Boost**: `PriceLevelCache` for faster best bid/ask lookups, `MatchingPool` to reduce matching engine allocations
- **Cleaner Architecture**: Refactored modification and matching logic for better separation of concerns
- **Enhanced Concurrency**: Improved thread-safe operations under heavy load

### Status
This project is in active development. The core matching engine, order validation, STP, fees, mass cancel, NATS integration, sequencer journal, and order state tracking are production-ready. The Sequencer runtime (async event loop) is under development.

## Performance Analysis of the OrderBook System

This analyzes the performance of the OrderBook system based on tests conducted on an Apple M4 Max processor. The data comes from a High-Frequency Trading (HFT) simulation and price level distribution performance tests. The figures below are representative single-run numbers measured on **orderbook-rs 0.9.0** with the bundled examples `orderbook_hft_simulation` and `orderbook_contention_test` (`cargo run --release -p examples --bin <name>`); absolute throughput is workload-, machine-, and run-dependent.

### 1. High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Simulation

#### Test Configuration
- **Symbol:** BTC/USD
- **Duration:** 5000 ms (5 seconds)
- **Threads:** 30 threads total
  - 10 maker threads (order creators)
  - 10 taker threads (order executors)
  - 10 canceller threads (order cancellers)
- **Initial orders:** 1020 pre-loaded orders

#### Performance Results

| Metric | Total Operations | Operations/Second |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Orders Added | 465,314 | 93,040.99 |
| Orders Matched | 191,555 | 38,302.02 |
| Orders Cancelled | 183,700 | 36,731.39 |
| **Total Operations** | **840,569** | **168,074.41** |

#### Initial vs. Final OrderBook State

| Metric | Initial State | Final State |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Best Bid | 9,900 | 9,840 |
| Best Ask | 10,000 | 10,010 |
| Spread | 100 | 170 |
| Mid Price | 9,950.00 | 9,925.00 |
| Total Orders | 1,020 | 44,987 |
| Bid Price Levels | 21 | 11 |
| Ask Price Levels | 21 | 12 |
| Total Bid Quantity | 7,750 | 346,031 |
| Total Ask Quantity | 7,750 | 473,092 |

### 2. Contention Pattern Performance Tests

#### Configuration
- **Threads:** 12
- **Test Duration:** 3000 ms per sub-test
- **Concurrent Operations:** Multi-threaded lock-free architecture

#### Read / Write Operation Ratio

Mixed read/write workload over 500 resting orders across 40 price levels;
the `Read %` is the fraction of operations that are read-only (snapshot /
best-price / depth queries) versus mutating (add / cancel / match).

| Read % | Operations/Second |
|------------|---------------------|
| 0%         | 305,435.88          |
| 25%        | 63,103.90           |
| 50%        | 51,933.72           |
| 75%        | 54,960.34           |
| 95%        | 100,379.54          |

#### Price Level Distribution

Throughput as the resting depth is spread across a varying number of price
levels (100 orders per level, except the 5- and 1-level cases which pack the
same orders into fewer levels).

| Price Levels | Operations/Second |
|--------------|---------------------|
| 100          | 184,986.35          |
| 50           | 188,085.24          |
| 10           | 70,338.52           |
| 5            | 68,610.25           |
| 1            | 61,302.26           |

#### Hot Spot Contention Test

All threads hammer a single shared price level (20 hot-spot orders + 480
regular); higher hot-spot percentages concentrate more operations on that one
lock-free level, where the `crossbeam-skiplist` + `dashmap` + atomics design
shines.

| % Operations on Hot Spot | Operations/Second   |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| 0%                       | 14,978,484.36       |
| 25%                      | 19,191,927.99       |
| 50%                      | 25,890,620.87       |
| 75%                      | 31,529,898.64       |
| 100%                     | 31,607,744.24       |

#### Performance Improvements and Deadlock Resolution

The significant performance gains, especially in the "Hot Spot Contention Test," and the resolution of the previous deadlocks are a direct result of refactoring the internal concurrency model of the `PriceLevel`.

- **Previous Bottleneck:** The original implementation relied on a `crossbeam::queue::SegQueue` for storing orders. While the queue itself is lock-free, operations like finding or removing a specific order required draining the entire queue into a temporary list, performing the action, and then pushing all elements back. This process was inefficient and created a major point of contention, leading to deadlocks under heavy multi-threaded load.

- **New Implementation:** The `OrderQueue` was re-designed to use a combination of:
  1. A `dashmap::DashMap` for storing orders, allowing for highly concurrent, O(1) average-case time complexity for insertions, lookups, and removals by `Id`.
  2. A sequence-keyed index (a `crossbeam_skiplist::SkipMap<sequence, Id>`) that maintains the crucial First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order for matching while still allowing O(log n) ordered iteration and deterministic snapshots.

This hybrid approach eliminates the previous bottleneck, allowing threads to operate on the order collection with minimal contention, which is reflected in the massive throughput increase in the hot spot tests.

### 3. Analysis and Conclusions

#### Overall Performance
The system demonstrates excellent capability to handle over **165,000 operations per second** in the high-frequency trading simulation, distributed across order creations, matches, and cancellations.

#### Price Level Distribution Behavior
- **Optimal Performance Range:** The system performs best with 50-100 price levels, achieving roughly 185,000-188,000 operations per second.
- **Performance Degradation:** Performance decreases with fewer price levels (more per-level contention), dropping to around 61,000-70,000 operations per second with 1-10 levels.
- **Scalability:** The lock-free architecture demonstrates excellent scalability characteristics across different price level distributions.

#### Hot Spot Contention
- Surprisingly, performance **increases** as more operations concentrate on a hot spot, reaching its maximum with 100% concentration (31,607,744 ops/s).
- This counter-intuitive behavior might indicate:
  1. Very efficient cache effects when operations are concentrated in one memory area
  2. Internal optimizations to handle high-contention cases
  3. Benefits of the system's lock-free architecture

#### OrderBook State Behavior
- During the HFT simulation, the order book handled a significant increase in order volume (from 1,020 to 44,987).
- The spread increased from 100 to 170, reflecting realistic market behavior under pressure.
- The final state shows substantial liquidity with over 346,000 bid quantity and 473,000 ask quantity.

### 4. Practical Implications

- The system is suitable for high-frequency trading environments with the capacity to process over 165,000 mixed operations per second (and tens of millions of operations per second on a single hot price level).
- The lock-free architecture proves to be extremely effective at handling contention, especially at hot spots.
- Optimal performance is achieved with moderate price level distribution (50-100 levels).
- For real-world use cases, the system demonstrates excellent scalability and maintains performance under concurrent load.

This analysis confirms that the system design is highly scalable and appropriate for demanding financial applications requiring high-speed processing with data consistency.
