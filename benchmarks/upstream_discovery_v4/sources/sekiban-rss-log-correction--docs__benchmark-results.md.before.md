# Event Sourcing Runtime Benchmark Report

This document tracks the current benchmark status for the Sekiban sample runtimes after the 2026-04-04 300K verification pass.

The current `300,000` event matrix now has fresh reruns for:

- Native C#
- C# WASM
- Rust WASM
- MoonBit WASM
- Go WASM
- TypeScript WASM

## Runtime Matrix

| Runtime | Host Path | Client API | WASM Module | Module Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C# Native | `submodules/Sekiban/templates/Sekiban.Dcb.Templates/content/Sekiban.Dcb.Orleans.Decider` | ASP.NET Core | N/A | N/A |
| C# WASM | `src/samples/Sekiban.Dcb.Orleans.Decider.Wasm` | ASP.NET Core proxy | `sekiban-dcb-decider.wasm` | ~35 MB |
| Rust WASM | `src/samples/Sekiban.Dcb.Orleans.Decider.Wasm.Rs` | Rust/Axum proxy | `sekiban-dcb-decider-rust.wasm` | ~728 KB |
| MoonBit WASM | `src/samples/Sekiban.Dcb.Orleans.Decider.Wasm.Mb` | Node proxy | `sekiban-dcb-decider-moonbit.wasm` | ~355 KB |
| Go WASM | `src/samples/Sekiban.Dcb.Orleans.Decider.Wasm.Go` | Go/net-http proxy | `go-weather.wasm` | ~1.3 MB |
| TypeScript WASM | `src/samples/Sekiban.Dcb.Orleans.Decider.Wasm.Ts` | Hono/Node proxy | `ts-weather.wasm` | ~239 KB |

There is currently no C-language WASM sample in this repository. No `C WASM` row is benchmarked below because there is no corresponding AppHost, module, or build pipeline under `src/samples/` or `src/wasm-projectors/`.

The C# WASM sample AppHost is now treated as WASM-only. It launches `wasmserver` and `clientapi` only, and the sample-native `SekibanDcbDecider.ApiService` source has been removed from this tree. Native benchmark and stability runs should start from the Sekiban template AppHost directly, not from `src/samples/Sekiban.Dcb.Orleans.Decider.Wasm`.

## MoonBit Shared Library Migration

As of 2026-04-07, MoonBit WASM now uses shared libraries extracted to `src/lib/sekiban-moonbit/`:

- **wasm-runtime** (`src/lib/sekiban-moonbit/wasm-runtime/`): FFI, memory management, generic types, projector callback registry, WASM exports, query helpers
- **client** (`src/lib/sekiban-moonbit/client/`): HTTP client (`SekibanRuntimeClient`), executor (`StaticTagProjectorResolver`, `finalize_command`), server framework (router, handlers)

The domain sample at `src/samples/Sekiban.Dcb.Orleans.Decider.Wasm.Mb/moonbit/runtime/` now imports these shared libraries via path dependencies. A verification 5K benchmark confirms the shared-library build produces identical runtime behavior to the previous monolithic build (0 errors, comparable throughput).

A full 300K benchmark was also run to validate at scale:

| Metric | Shared-lib 300K | Previous 300K (monolithic) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Weather events/sec | `1479` | `1461` |
| Reservation events/sec | `580` | `557` |
| Reservation ops/sec | `223` | `214` |
| Query ops/sec | `4` | `165` |
| Total wall-clock | `427.0 s` | `340.9 s` |
| Peak RSS | `~1389 MB` | `~1302 MB` |
| Errors | `0` | `0` |

Command-side throughput is comparable or slightly improved after the shared library migration. Query throughput was lower in this run, likely due to host load variability rather than the migration itself. The WASM module size remains ~358 KB (release build), unchanged from the pre-migration build.

## Benchmark Method

- Tool: `benchmarks/Sekiban.Benchmark.Cli`
- Scenario split:
  - Setup
  - Weather bulk write: 60%
  - Reservation lifecycle: 40%
  - Query performance: 250 queries
- Concurrency: `8`
- Target events: `300,000` for the current matrix, `30,000` for the earlier comparable rerun
- Database: Aspire-managed PostgreSQL
- Storage provider: `postgres`

All three WASM AppHosts now use the same WasmServer tuning:

- `SEKIBAN_WASM_CATCHUP_CONCURRENCY=4`
- `SEKIBAN_WASM_MULTIPROJECTION_CATCHUP_BATCH_SIZE=250`
- `SEKIBAN_WASM_AUTO_COMPACTION_INTERVAL_EVENTS=20000`
- `SEKIBAN_WASM_FORCE_COMPACTING_GC_AFTER_COMPACTION=true`
- `SEKIBAN_WASMTIME_STATIC_MEMORY_MAX_MB=192`
- `WASM_RUNTIME_ALLOWED_TAG_EVENT_TYPES__RoomProjector=RoomCreated,RoomUpdated,RoomDeactivated,RoomReactivated`

The last setting is important for the C# WASM fix: it prevents `RoomProjector` cached tag-state replay from reapplying reservation-tagged events that do not belong to room-state evolution.

## 2026-04-04 Fresh 300K Matrix

The table below uses fresh `300,000` event runs from current `main` where available.

| Runtime | Status | Weather events/sec | Reservation events/sec | Reservation ops/sec | Query ops/sec | Total wall-clock | Peak RSS | Errors |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| C# Native | `completed` | `2004.1` | `236.7` | `91.0` | `1586.5` | `597.6 s` | `~2626.4 MB` | `0` |
| C# WASM | `completed` | `1355.3` | `1882.1` | `723.8` | `115.1` | `199.4 s` | `~2594.2 MB` | `0` |
| Rust WASM | `completed` | `1565.3` | `561.0` | `215.7` | `754.0` | `329.8 s` | `~1312.7 MB` | `0` |
| MoonBit WASM | `completed` | `1460.5` | `556.8` | `214.1` | `164.5` | `340.9 s` | `~1961.6 MB` | `0` |
| Go WASM | `completed` | `1547.8` | `520.1` | `200.0` | `335.8` | `388.5 s` | `~2502.4 MB` | `0` |
| TypeScript WASM | `completed` | `1494.7` | `559.3` | `215.1` | `2.0` | `498.7 s` | `~1724.1 MB` | `0` |
| C WASM | `not implemented in repo` | `n/a` | `n/a` | `n/a` | `n/a` | `n/a` | `n/a` | `n/a` |

Latency summary:

| Runtime | Weather p50 / p95 | Reservation p50 / p95 | Query p50 / p95 |
|---|---|---|---|
| C# Native | `3.8 / 5.4 ms` | `66.0 / 225.5 ms` | `0.2 / 0.4 ms` |
| C# WASM | `5.7 / 7.8 ms` | `10.0 / 14.0 ms` | `4.2 / 22.9 ms` |
| Rust WASM | `4.9 / 6.7 ms` | `36.4 / 64.8 ms` | `0.8 / 1.5 ms` |
| MoonBit WASM | `5.3 / 7.3 ms` | `38.7 / 61.2 ms` | `2.0 / 22.1 ms` |
| Go WASM | `5.0 / 6.7 ms` | `37.6 / 66.2 ms` | `1.3 / 7.2 ms` |
| TypeScript WASM | `5.2 / 7.1 ms` | `36.8 / 64.6 ms` | `7.1 / 3999.2 ms` |

Current takeaways:

- All six runtimes now complete `300K` with zero errors.
- C# WASM remains the fastest command path at `300K` among all runtimes, and it still stays under the original `4 GB` memory target.
- Native C# now completes `300K` cleanly and stays under `4 GB`, but its reservation phase still decays from roughly `670 eps` at the start to roughly `125 eps` at the end of the run.
- Rust WASM, MoonBit WASM, Go WASM, and TypeScript WASM all have very similar command-side throughput, around `520-561` reservation events/sec.
- Rust WASM has the smallest memory footprint at `~1313 MB` and the best query throughput at `754 ops/sec`.
- Go WASM has strong query performance (`335.8 ops/sec`) but the highest memory usage among WASM runtimes at `~2502 MB`.
- TypeScript WASM has the smallest WASM module size (`~239 KB`) and competitive command throughput, but its query phase is severely degraded (`2.0 ops/sec`, p95 `~4 s`) — likely a cold-start or GC issue in the Hono/Node client API layer.
- MoonBit WASM is materially slower on query throughput than Rust WASM, but still clearly faster than C# WASM on the query phase.
- Native C# is no longer blocked by the earlier benchmark setup issue, but it is still the highest-priority scalability target because reservation throughput remains much lower than its `30K` profile.

### Native C# 300K Completion Note

The current native rerun against the Sekiban template AppHost now completes with `0` errors:

- weather phase completed at `2004.1 events/sec`
- reservation phase completed at `236.7 events/sec` overall and `91.0 ops/sec`
- reservation interval throughput still decayed steadily during the run, from roughly `673 eps` at the start to roughly `124-140 eps` at the end
- peak sampled RSS was `~2626.4 MB`
- query phase completed at `1586.5 ops/sec`

The previous aborted native runs turned out to mix two different problems:

- the benchmark was under-provisioning rooms for `300K`, so conflict-checked implementations eventually ran out of unique reservation slots
- the native template quick-reservation path and room reservation state were doing more work than necessary per command

That benchmark-side issue is now fixed, so the current native `300K` result is a trustworthy completion result. The remaining issue is throughput decay, not correctness.

## 2026-04-03 Fresh Comparable 30K Rerun

The native row below now comes from a direct run against the Sekiban template AppHost. It no longer uses the mixed `src/samples/Sekiban.Dcb.Orleans.Decider.Wasm` host.

Throughput table:

| Runtime | Weather events/sec | Reservation events/sec | Query ops/sec | Total wall-clock | Errors |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| C# Native | `1855.5` | `1719.6` | `1723.6` | `17.2 s` | `0` |
| C# WASM | `1329.6` | `1907.2` | `38.2` | `26.5 s` | `0` |
| Rust WASM | `1336.8` | `1111.6` | `702.1` | `25.1 s` | `0` |
| MoonBit WASM | `1284.1` | `1020.0` | `151.9` | `27.9 s` | `0` |

Latency table:

| Runtime | Weather p50 / p95 | Reservation p50 / p95 | Query p50 / p95 |
|---|---|---|---|
| C# Native | `4.1 / 5.7 ms` | `11.4 / 15.7 ms` | `0.2 / 0.4 ms` |
| C# WASM | `5.8 / 7.8 ms` | `10.2 / 14.0 ms` | `13.3 / 52.9 ms` |
| Rust WASM | `5.7 / 8.2 ms` | `19.6 / 25.1 ms` | `0.8 / 1.7 ms` |
| MoonBit WASM | `6.0 / 8.4 ms` | `21.9 / 27.9 ms` | `2.5 / 22.9 ms` |

Observed peak RSS:

| Runtime | Peak RSS | Note |
|---|---:|---|
| C# Native | `not remeasured` | the template-direct separation pass reran throughput only; the older mixed-host follow-up had `~1879.6 MB` peak RSS |
| C# WASM | `~2041.3 MB` | sampled during `cs-wasm-30k-20260403-fixed-rss` |
| Rust WASM | `~558.0 MB` | sampled during `rs-wasm-30k-20260403` |
| MoonBit WASM | `~545.6 MB` | sampled during `mb-wasm-30k-20260403` |

### 30K Takeaways

- The major C# WASM reservation regression is fixed. Reservation throughput improved from `60.6` events/sec on the earlier 2026-04-03 baseline to `1907.2` events/sec on the current run.
- C# WASM no longer fails reservation progression by corrupting `RoomProjector` tag-state after reservation writes.
- Native C# remains the strongest overall implementation at `30K`, but that does not carry over to the current `300K` run.
- Rust WASM currently has the best query throughput by a large margin.
- Rust WASM and MoonBit WASM still keep the smallest RSS footprints, both around `0.55 GB`.
- C# WASM now fits comfortably under the `4 GB` goal, but query performance is still the weakest measured path.

## Native C# Fixes Applied For 300K Rerun

The current native template rerun includes both benchmark-side and Sekiban template-side fixes:

1. `SetupScenario` now provisions enough rooms for the reservation event target instead of assuming the old fixed `20`-room setup.
2. `HttpApiClient` now retries native auth endpoints during startup, so fresh AppHost launches do not lose the setup phase to transient `401` responses.
3. `QuickReservationWorkflow` now uses a single `CreateQuickReservation` command instead of executing draft, hold, and confirm as separate round trips.
4. `RoomReservationTag` separates room reservation conflict tracking from `RoomTag`, so room metadata state is no longer polluted by all reservation writes.
5. `RoomReservationsState` now mutates in place and keeps a day index, reducing per-command copying and limiting conflict scans to relevant day buckets.
6. `ReservationListProjection` and `ApprovalRequestListProjection` now update their dictionaries in place instead of cloning the full map for every event.

## C# WASM Regression Fixes Applied

The following changes were applied before the 2026-04-03 rerun:

1. `RemoteCommandContext` now caches tag-state and latest-sortable lookups within a single remote command execution.
2. `QuickReservationWorkflow` no longer issues a full room-list read before every quick reservation.
3. `CreateQuickReservation` and `CreateReservationDraft` no longer perform redundant room existence lookups before loading room state.
4. `KnownTagExistenceProbe` replaces the unsafe direct tracker-only fast path so tag existence is backfilled from the actor layer when needed.
5. `SharedTagStateProcessor` now supports projector-scoped allowlists for delta replay, and `RoomProjector` is restricted to room lifecycle events only.
6. The C#, Rust, and MoonBit AppHosts all pass the same `RoomProjector` allowlist into WasmServer.

### C# WASM Before / After

This compares the broken 2026-04-03 baseline (`cs-wasm-30k-20260403`) with the fixed run (`cs-wasm-30k-20260403-fixed-rss`):

| Metric | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| Reservation events/sec | `60.6` | `1907.2` |
| Reservation p95 | `620.6 ms` | `14.0 ms` |
| Total wall-clock | `213.7 s` | `26.5 s` |
| Peak RSS | `~2536.1 MB` | `~2041.3 MB` |
| Reservation errors | `0` | `0` |

The earlier failed optimization attempts from the same day (`cs-wasm-30k-20260403-opt` and `cs-wasm-30k-20260403-cache`) showed why the final fix needed projector-aware filtering:

- they produced very low reported reservation event throughput because most reservation operations failed immediately
- they emitted `7980` reservation errors
- they did not preserve valid room-state after reservation-tagged writes

## Remaining Bottlenecks

- C# WASM query throughput is still far below Rust WASM and still below MoonBit WASM. The main remaining gap is query-side state access rather than reservation command execution.
- Rust WASM, MoonBit WASM, Go WASM, and TypeScript WASM now all complete `300K` cleanly, but their reservation lifecycle throughput trails the fixed C# WASM path by roughly `3.4x`.
- TypeScript WASM query throughput is extremely low (`2.0 ops/sec`) at `300K`. The command phase performs well, so the bottleneck is likely in the Hono/Node client API query path or garbage collection pauses under high state volume.
- Go WASM has the highest memory usage among WASM runtimes (`~2502 MB`), close to C# WASM. The TinyGo runtime and linear memory growth likely account for this.
- Native C# now has the highest-priority scalability issue in this repo. The `300K` reservation path needs profiling before it can be treated as a valid baseline again.
