# CI and release evidence

Tine concentrates broad CI at the release boundary. Ordinary coding should use
the causal test for the changed behavior plus directly affected neighbors; it
should not repeatedly start every platform build and performance comparison.
The frozen release candidate receives the exhaustive pass.

## What runs when

| Event | Automatic work | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Non-doc pull request | `ci` → `PR validation / Linux unit and contract checks` | TypeScript, frontend and Rust-core tests plus cheap generated-artifact/release contract guards. No Windows, Android, performance, Flatpak build, or release packaging. |
| Docs/image-only pull request | No app CI | Avoid runner work for prose and image-only changes. A Flatpak/website metadata PR still gets its path-specific lightweight validator. |
| Push to `master` | No app test/build workflow | Merging does not repeat CI after the reviewed commit. Website pushes may still deploy Pages; issue automation is separate from app CI. |
| Manual `ci`, scope `full` | Linux contracts/tests plus four deterministic process-isolated `tine-core` nextest shards, Windows compile-all `tine-core` targets + contract-selected cross-layer integration smoke, Android core compile, same-runner performance A/B | Required exact-SHA release-candidate evidence against the certified `tine-storage` pin. |
| Manual `ci`, focused scope | Only `windows`, `android`, or `performance` | Platform/performance proof while developing relevant changes. A focused run never satisfies the release gate. |
| Manual `ui-e2e` | Complete or scenario-focused Linux/Windows real-app proof | UI/harness debugging between releases without starting ordinary full CI. |
| Manual `Flatpak build test` | Real offline Flatpak build | Focused packaging proof. The release workflow calls the same workflow as a hard gate. |
| Manual/tagged `release` | Exact-SHA CI evidence check, release preflight, real Flatpak, desktop/Android packages, release E2E, assembly/publish | Expensive release proof. It fails before packaging if the exact candidate lacks successful full CI evidence. |

The lightweight pull-request path is a useful early signal, not release
evidence. Platform-native or observation-boundary proof remains necessary when
the changed behavior requires it.

## Frozen-candidate sequence

1. Finish release metadata and all source changes, freeze one commit, and push
   its branch.
2. Dispatch `ci.yml` on that branch with `scope=full` and wait for all nine full
   jobs, including the Linux inventory contract and each of its four hash shards.
   Record the exact commit and Actions run URL.
3. Optionally verify the same evidence from the checkout:

   ```bash
   GH_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" node scripts/check-ci-evidence.mjs \
     --repo martinkoutecky/tine --sha "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
   ```

4. Dispatch `release.yml` on the same frozen branch. Its preflight performs the
   evidence check independently before toolchain/dependency setup or packaging.
5. After the manual release matrix and candidate assembly succeed, tag that
   exact commit only with explicit release authority. The tag-triggered release
   repeats the evidence check before it builds or publishes artifacts.

Any source/rebase/version change creates a new SHA and invalidates both the full
CI evidence and the assembled candidate. Dispatch full CI again for the new SHA;
never reuse a green run from its parent. After a failure, rerun all jobs (not
only the failed job) so the latest workflow attempt contains fresh successful
evidence for all nine full lanes while Actions retains the failed attempt.

`scripts/check-ci-evidence.mjs` requires a completed manual `ci.yml` run whose
`head_sha` is exact and whose nine stable full-job names all concluded
`success`. That list includes all four Linux nextest shards, so a missing or
skipped shard cannot satisfy the gate. PR runs, focused runs, skipped jobs,
failed jobs, and merely green release runs cannot satisfy it.
`scripts/test-release-pipeline.mjs` keeps this fail-closed contract under
deterministic fixtures.

## Windows release scope

Linux is Tine's complete behavior matrix: its nextest inventory contract proves
every non-ignored `tine-core` test runs exactly once across four isolated
shards. Those tests exercise Tine's semantic and lifecycle integration with the
exact certified `tine-storage` pin. The package's own complete Linux, Windows,
Android, format, crash-cut, and API matrix runs when a storage version is cut;
ordinary Tine releases do not pay for it again.

Windows is a deliberately narrower, blocking compatibility gate: it compiles
every `tine-core` test target against the pin and runs a declared cross-layer
smoke selection under nextest isolation. The selection contains every explicitly Windows-named core test plus the
bootstrap-capture, bootstrap-preparation, durability, and lifecycle witnesses
that caught the v0.6.90 Windows failures.

`scripts/tine-core-nextest-contract.mjs --mode windows --run-smoke` lists the
actual Windows core inventory before executing the smoke. It fails if an
explicitly Windows-named core test or declared witness is added, renamed,
removed, or omitted; it then runs that verified core/storage integration set
with nextest's zero-retry, fail-on-timeout profile. This is neither an advisory
subset nor a retry mask.

Full runtime parity for all `tine-core` tests on Windows is explicitly deferred.
Some platform-neutral core fixtures encode Unix-like file/identity assumptions;
they remain fully blocking on Linux. The complete cross-platform physical suite
is required by `tine-storage` certification before Tine can advance its pin.
Promoting a broader Windows core matrix is a separate compatibility project,
not a quiet gate expansion during a release.

## Between releases

- Run focused local tests while editing and the affected behavior family's
  real-app proof before integration when relevant.
- Dispatch `ui-e2e` for Linux/Windows harness or native UI changes.
- Dispatch manual `ci` with `scope=windows`, `scope=android`, or
  `scope=performance` when that platform boundary is the thing being changed.
- Dispatch the Flatpak workflow for offline packaging changes.
- Do not dispatch `scope=full` as a routine completion ritual. It is the frozen
  release gate.
